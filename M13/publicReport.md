# ü©∫ Medical Interconsultation Platform ‚Äî A Scalable Solution for Clinical Support Between Professionals

In today‚Äôs medical landscape, particularly within the early years of a physician‚Äôs career, it‚Äôs common for recently graduated doctors to face significant challenges. Many are quickly placed in high-responsibility roles, often in locations where they lack direct supervision or mentoring. This leads to clinical uncertainty, anxiety, and, in some cases, poor decision-making due to lack of support.

To address this issue, we‚Äôve developed a structured medical interconsultation platform designed to connect junior doctors with experienced physicians in a practical, fast, and secure way. Through a robust ecosystem of integrated services, we aim not only to reduce clinical insecurity, but also to foster continuous learning, professional collaboration, and recognition of medical expertise.

## üí° The Pain We Solve

- **Clinical isolation**: Many junior doctors work in environments where expert support is unavailable.
- **Lack of safe spaces to ask questions**: Medical culture often discourages open sharing of doubts and vulnerabilities.
- **Insecurity in clinical decision-making**: Time pressure combined with limited experience is a dangerous formula.
- **Absence of structured mentorship**: Even when senior professionals are present, time constraints often prevent meaningful guidance.

## üéØ Research

To validate the core hypothesis of the platform ‚Äî that there is a real demand for a structured tool facilitating communication between junior and experienced doctors ‚Äî we created a short online survey. The questions aimed to uncover pain points and habits of both early-career physicians and experienced specialists.

### üìâ Survey Challenges

Despite significant outreach efforts to our network of medical professionals ‚Äî including recent graduates, residents, and specialists ‚Äî we received only five responses.

While the sample size was lower than expected, the survey was designed to be quick and accessible, requiring only brief paragraph answers. Even so, the insights gathered were highly valuable and helped confirm our product thesis.

### ‚úÖ Key Findings

- All respondents acknowledged the value of being able to connect with fellow doctors to seek second opinions during clinical assessments or patient follow-ups.
- Respondents also shared their current app habits, allowing us to understand which platforms are already integrated into their daily routines. This helped identify potential benchmarks for UX/UI design and unmet needs left by existing tools.
- There was some variation in perceived monetary value for the solution, with responses ranging from R$30 to R$200. However, the average perceived value closely aligned with our projected pricing model, reinforcing the feasibility of our subscription-based business strategy.

## üß™ Prototyping Process

### üé® Design Inspiration

To build the first interactive prototype, we drew inspiration from various well-established apps, both in functionality and user experience:

- Brainly, for collaborative Q&A patterns;
- iFood, for smooth flows and intuitive design;
- An internal health-focused app developed during the 10th module at Inteli, aimed at solving problems in the pharmaceutical workflow at Hospital S√≠rio-Liban√™s.

### üîÑ User Flow Design for Mobile Application

The main challenge during prototyping was crafting a user journey that balanced simplicity and speed with the security and information validation required in a healthcare environment. We prioritized keeping the core flow efficient, while ensuring that user data and actions would be properly verified and securely handled.

#### üß© Main Flows

These screens form the core interaction loop for interconsultation between doctors:

- Login
- Sign-up
- Home Dashboard
- Request Interconsultation
- Response to Request
- Chat Interface
- Optional Video Call
- Feedback / Evaluation

#### üåê Supporting Flows

In addition to the primary features, we designed secondary flows that enrich the user experience and provide access to content and settings:

**From Home:**

- Medical News
- Articles
- Educational Videos
- Podcasts

**From Sidebar:**

- About Us
- Help / Support
- User Profile
- Consultation History
- Subscription Management
- App Settings

Each of these flows was designed based on insights from the business rules and user stories outlined during early modeling. They are intended to anticipate user needs and provide a complete experience beyond the core service.

## üß† Backend Focus ‚Äî Interconsultation Platform

The backend of this platform is designed to orchestrate the entire interconsultation experience between medical professionals, ensuring everything runs smoothly behind the scenes. Its primary mission is to connect people, manage interactions, and support decision-making, all while keeping the experience seamless and trustworthy.

It handles things like:

- Making sure doctors can easily find and connect with each other;
- Ensuring that all requests, conversations, and feedback are organized and accessible;
- Sending real-time notifications to keep users informed;
- Supporting systems that reward meaningful contributions and track user progress;
- Making the experience feel effortless, while silently ensuring security, reliability, and clarity in every step.

In short, the backend is the invisible engine that keeps the platform running ‚Äî quietly enabling medical professionals to collaborate, learn from each other, and deliver better care.

## üí∞ Business Model

We operate under a monthly subscription model targeting junior doctors seeking continuous clinical support. Subscription tiers may vary based on the number of consultations allowed, access to detailed reports, consultation history, or visibility within the network.

For experienced physicians, we leverage non-monetary incentives at first, such as public recognition, profile statistics, and achievement badges. Over time, we plan to evolve into a model that includes financial rewards or exclusive benefits for high-engagement users ‚Äî transforming the platform into a professional network of purposeful collaboration.
